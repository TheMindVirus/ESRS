Edge Server Request System - A free alternative to using money for purchasing Technology products

https://github.com/TheMindVirus/ESRS/blob/main/esrs.csv#L2

Consumers constantly purchasing technology from Manufacturers and Retailers \
every time a new product is released is a supply and demand problem. \
This is a short term issue which eases when demand is fulfilled but is made worse \
by scalpers making sure the demand is never fulfilled or when there is insatiable demand.

This can be remedied by the Edge Server Request System (ESRS). \
Each household and small community makerspace should receive one 1U Datacenter Specification Rack Unit. \
Each unit will contain a certificate matching the location of its deployment and is limited to one per location. \
The server should contain one or otherwise several .csv plain-text files listing URL's of user-requested products.

The .csv file should be placed on the public data section of the server so that fulfilment centers can see it, \
or network bandwidth is used up to repeatedly make requests for the same product list on a schedule. \
This way, a manufacturer, distributor, makerspace or other fulfilment center can automatically look through the requests, \
check inventory and approve the requests before they are fulfilled by the logistical system for the required locality.

Requiring money to purchase technology makes sure that only a select few communities actually receive the products that \
they ordered in the condition that they expected. Moreover, the idea of ordering products puts pressure on manufacturers \
and retailers to fulfill every order that was placed regardless of if the product actually needed to go to that location. \
ESRS may be a step closer to fair distribution of components, especially to those who cannot afford paid purchases for essentials.

A step further would involve the integration of a "Request" button on e-commerce web front-ends with automated integration \
with the locally deployed edge server's .csv file in memory, with the required authentication and attestation principles implemented. \
This should in theory make it simpler for people who don't want to manually edit a .csv file to receive the assistance they need. \
In some form it is already integrated as a Wish-List, Browser Cookies and Laptops but yet the distribution still skews towards scalpers.
